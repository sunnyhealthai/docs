description: Learn how to define webhooks in the Fern Definition

In Fern, you can specify webhooks in your API definition. The webhooks will be included 
in both the generated SDKs and the API documentation.

## Webhook definition

Each webhook defines:

1. **Method**: The HTTP Method that the webhook will use (either `GET` or `POST`)
2. **Headers**: The headers that the webhook will send
3. **Payload**: The schema of the webhook payload

<CodeBlock title='webhooks.yml'>
  ```yaml {2-10}
  webhooks: 
    paymentNotification: 
      display-name: Payment Notification
      docs: Receive a notification when a payment changes status
      method: POST 
      headers: 
        X-Signature-Primary: 
          type: string 
          docs: An HMAC signature of the payload
      payload: PaymentNotificationPayload
  
  types: 
    PaymentNotificationPayload: 
      discriminant: notificationType
      union: 
        queued: QueuedPaymentNotification
        processing: ProcessingPaymentNotification
        completed: CompletedPaymentNotification
  ```
</CodeBlock>

### Inlined payloads

You can inline the schema of the payload by doing the following: 

<CodeBlock title='webhooks.yml'>
  ```yaml
  webhooks: 
    paymentNotification: 
      display-name: Payment Notification
      docs: Receive a notification when a payment changes status
      method: POST 
      headers: 
        X-Signature-Primary: 
          type: string 
          docs: An HMAC signature of the payload
      payload:
        name: PaymentNotificationPayload
        properties: 
          id:
            type: string
            docs: The notification id
          amount: double
          currency: Currency
  ```
</CodeBlock>

## Generate webhook reference

Fern Docs can automatically generate your webhook reference documentation from your definition. Set this up in your `docs.yml` file. 

Your webhook reference can be a single documentation page:

```yml docs.yml
navigation:
  - api: Webhook Reference # Display name for this page
    api-name: webhooks-v1 # Directory containing webhook definition
```

Or you can configure individual documentation pages per webhook event:

```yaml title="docs.yml"
navigation:
  - subpackage_api.newPlantWebhook # Format: subpackage_{name-of-api}.{webhook-event-name}
```

For more information on how to configure your webhook reference in `docs.yml`, see [Generate your webhook reference](/docs/api-references/generate-webhook-reference).

## SDK verification utilities

Fern automatically generates webhook signature verification utilities in your SDKs based on your webhook definitions. For more information, see [Webhook signature verification](/learn/sdks/deep-dives/sdk-user-features#webhook-signature-verification).
