title: Availability in Fern Definition
description: >-
  Add availability to Fern Definition API services, endpoints, types, or
  properties to indicate their release status.
---

You can add `availability` to an endpoint, type, or property within your Fern Definition. You can configure the `availability` of sections in your API Reference documentation in your [`docs.yml` file](/learn/docs/configuration/site-level-settings). 

## Endpoints, types, and properties

Availability can be:
- `in-development` which means it is being worked on; will show a `Beta` tag
- `pre-release` which means it is available; will show a `Beta` tag
- `deprecated` which means it will be removed in the future; will show a `Deprecated` tag
- `generally-available` which means it is stable and available for use; will show a `GA` tag

### Endpoint 

<CodeBlock title="pet.yml">
```yaml {6}
service:
  base-path: /pet
  auth: true
  endpoints:
    add:
      availability: deprecated
      display-name: Add pet
      docs: Add a new Pet to the store
      method: POST
      path: ""
      request: AddPetRequest
      response: Pet
```
</CodeBlock>

In Fern Docs, this will look like:

## Sections

You can set the availability for the entire API reference or for specific sections in your `docs.yml` configuration. Options are: `stable`, `generally-available`, `in-development`, `pre-release`, `deprecated`, or `beta`. 

When you set the availability of a section, all of the endpoints in that section are automatically marked with that availability unless explicitly set otherwise. 

```yaml title="docs.yml" {3, 6}
navigation: 
  - api: API Reference
    availability: generally-available
    layout: 
      - section: My Section
        availability: beta
        icon: flower
        contents: 
        # endpoints here
```
